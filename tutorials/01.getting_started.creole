= Getting Started with Py2neo

Py2neo communicates with a Neo4j database via its RESTful HTTP interface. A {{{GraphDatabaseService}}} is exposed via the Neo4j server facility under a specific URI which, as described in the offical Neo4j documentation, is [[http://localhost:7474/db/data/]] within a default installation.

A {{{GraphDatabaseService}}} can be accessed in py2neo simply by creating an instance of the class with the same name. This class exists within the {{{py2neo.neo4j}}} module and requires the URI under which the service is exposed as an argument. The code below shows how to create such a connection:

{{{
from py2neo import neo4j
graph_db = neo4j.GraphDatabaseService("http://localhost:7474/db/data/")
}}}

Once a connection has been established, nodes can be added to the graph using one of several methods. To create a single node, the {{{create_node}}} method can be used. If more than one node needs to be added, it is more efficient to use the batch creation method {{{create_nodes}}}. Finally, a Cypher {{{CREATE}}} statement can also be used. The code below illustrates these three node creation methods:

{{{
<<code lang="python">>
# create one node
a = graph_db.create_node({"name": "Alice"})

# create several nodes at once
b, c = graph_db.create_nodes(
    {"name": "Bob"},
    {"name": "Carol"}
}

# create a node using Cypher
from py2neo import cypher
query = "create d = {name: 'Dave'} return d"
data, metadata = cypher.execute(graph_db, query)
d = data[0][0]
<</code>>
}}}
