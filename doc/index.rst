Py2neo
======

Py2neo is a simple and pragmatic Python library that provides access to the
popular graph database Neo4j via its RESTful web service interface. With no
external dependencies, installation is straightforward and getting started
with coding is easy. The library is actively maintained on GitHub, regularly
updated in the Python Package Index and is built uniquely for Neo4j in close
association with its team and community.

In addition, the library provides support for the Graph Export Object File
Format (Geoff). For further information on Geoff, visit
