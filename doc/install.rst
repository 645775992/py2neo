Installation
============

Requirements
------------

You will need to be running version 1.8.1 or above of Neo4j (available from
http://neo4j.org/) in order to use the full feature set of py2neo. Reduced
capabilities will be available for server versions 1.6 and 1.7.

Your Python version should be at least 2.6 although 2.7 is recommended. Py2neo
is also fully compatible with Python 3. Partial support exists for Jython - if
you are using this then please help to improve support by providing feedback.
