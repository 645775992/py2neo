`Cypher <http://www.neo4j.org/learn/cypher>`_ is to Neo4j as SQL is to
relational databases. It is a declarative language that provides facilities
to query and manipulate data within a graph database using a syntax which is
both quick to learn and easy to read. Py2neo provides functionality to allow
Cypher queries to be executed as the results to be iterated through.
