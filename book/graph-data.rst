Graph Data Fundamentals
=======================

Before connecting to a Neo4j server, it's useful to become familiar with the fundamental data types of the property graph model offered by py2neo.
While the types described here are completely compatible with Neo4j, they can also be used independently of it.

The two essential building blocks are :class:`.Node` and :class:`.Relationship`.
Along with the container types :class:`.Subgraph` and :class:`.Walkable`, these provide a way to construct and work with Neo4j-compatible graph data.
The four types can be summarised as follows:

- :class:`.Node` - fundamental unit of data storage within a graph
- :class:`.Relationship` - typed connection between a pair of nodes
- :class:`.Subgraph` - collection of nodes and relationships
- :class:`.Walkable` - subgraph with added traversal information

The example below shows how to create a couple of nodes and a relationship joining them.
Each node has a single property, `name`, and is labelled as a `Person`.
The relationship ``ab`` describes a connection from the first node ``a`` to the second node ``b`` of type `KNOWS`.

::

    >>> from py2neo import Node, Relationship
    >>> a = Node("Person", name="Alice")
    >>> b = Node("Person", name="Bob")
    >>> ab = Relationship(a, "KNOWS", b)

Relationship types can alternatively be determined by a class that extends the :class:`.Relationship` class.
The default type of such relationships is derived from the class name::

    >>> c = Node("Person", name="Carol")
    >>> class WorksWith(Relationship): pass
    >>> ac = WorksWith(a, c)
    >>> ac.type()
    'WORKS_WITH'

Arbitrary collections of nodes and relationships may be contained in a :class:`.Subgraph` object.
The simplest way to construct these is by combining nodes and relationships with standard set operations.
For example::

    >>> s = ab | ac
    >>> s
    {(xyz01:Person {name:"Alice"}),
     (xyz02:Person {name:"Bob"}),
     (xyz03:Person {name:"Carol"}),
     (xyz01)-[:KNOWS]->(xyz02),
     (xyz01)-[:WORKS_WITH]->(xyz03)}
    >>> s.nodes()
    frozenset({(xyz01:Person {name:"Alice"}),
               (xyz02:Person {name:"Bob"}),
               (xyz03:Person {name:"Carol"})})
    >>> s.relationships()
    frozenset({(xyz01)-[:KNOWS]->(xyz02),
               (xyz01)-[:WORKS_WITH]->(xyz03)})

The full range of available operations are:

====================  ===========  ===========
Operation             Notation     Result
====================  ===========  ===========
union                 ``s1 | s2``  A subgraph containing all nodes and relationships from `s1` and `s2` combined
intersection          ``s1 & s2``  A subgraph containing all nodes and relationships common to both `s1` and `s2`
difference            ``s1 - s2``  All nodes and relationships from `s1` excluding those that are also in `s2`
symmetric difference  ``s1 ^ s2``  All nodes and relationships in either `s1` or `s2` but not both
====================  ===========  ===========

A :class:`.Walkable` is a subgraph with added traversal information.
These can be formed by concatenating nodes and relationships::

    >>> w = ab + Relationship(b, "LIKES", c) + ac
    >>> w
    (xyz01)-[:KNOWS]->(xyz02)-[:LIKES]->(xyz03)<-[:WORKS_WITH]-(xyz01)
