Graph Data Fundamentals
=======================

Before connecting to a Neo4j server, it's useful to become familiar with the fundamental data types of the property graph model offered by py2neo.


Nodes & Relationships
=====================

.. autoclass:: py2neo.Node
   :members:
   :inherited-members:

.. autoclass:: py2neo.Relationship
   :members:
   :inherited-members:


Graph Arithmetic
================

.. autoclass:: py2neo.Subgraph
   :members:
   :inherited-members:


Paths & Traversal
=================

.. autoclass:: py2neo.Path
   :members:
   :inherited-members:

.. autoclass:: py2neo.TraversableSubgraph
   :members:
   :inherited-members:

.. autofunction:: py2neo.traverse
