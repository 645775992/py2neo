Before connecting to a Neo4j server, it's useful to become familiar with the fundamental data types of the property graph model offered by py2neo.


Nodes & Relationships
=====================

.. autoclass:: py2neo.graph.Node
   :show-inheritance:
   :members:

.. autoclass:: py2neo.graph.Relationship
   :show-inheritance:
   :members:


Graph Arithmetic
================

.. autoclass:: py2neo.graph.Subgraph
   :show-inheritance:
   :members:


Paths & Traversal
=================

.. autoclass:: py2neo.graph.Path
   :show-inheritance:
   :members:

.. autoclass:: py2neo.graph.TraversableSubgraph
   :show-inheritance:
   :members:

.. autofunction:: py2neo.traverse
