The Py2neo v3 Handbook
**********************

**Py2neo** is a client library and toolkit for working with Neo4j_ from within Python_ applications and from the command line.
The core library has no external dependencies and has been carefully designed to be easy and intuitive to use.

.. note:: Documentation for the 2.0 series is available `here <http://py2neo.org/2.0>`_.


Installation
============

To install the latest stable version of py2neo, simply use pip_::

    $ pip install py2neo


To install the latest bleeding edge code directly from GitHub, use::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/nigelsmall/py2neo.git#egg=py2neo

Note that this code is likely to be unstable.
Your mileage may vary.


Requirements
============

The following versions of Python and Neo4j are supported:

- Python 2.7 / 3.3 / 3.4 / 3.5
- Neo4j 2.0 / 2.1 / 2.2 / 2.3 / 3.0 (the latest point release of each version is recommended)

Note also that Py2neo is developed and tested exclusively under **Linux** using standard CPython distributions.
While other operating systems and Python distributions may work, support for these is not available.
